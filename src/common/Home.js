        <h2>Junior Software Developer</h2>
        <p>I am privileged to have had a diverse professional journey in multiple geo- locations that gave me exposure to different industries, in addition to various cultures and work ethics. However, I have always been drawn to programming and consider it my passion. I began self- learning from a range of resources and decided I was ready to learn in a structured professional environment which led to taking General Assemblyâ€™s Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp.
I am eager to start my career in tech and progress my passion for programming in a professional environment.</p>

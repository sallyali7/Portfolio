            <p>Privileged to have had a diverse professional journey in multiple geo-locations that gave me exposure to different industries, in addition to various cultures and work ethics. However, I have always been drawn to programming and consider it my passion. I began self-learning from a range of resources and decided I was ready to learn in a structured professional environment which led to taking General Assemblyâ€™s Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp. 
I am eager to start my career in tech and progress my passion for programming in a professional environment. </p>
